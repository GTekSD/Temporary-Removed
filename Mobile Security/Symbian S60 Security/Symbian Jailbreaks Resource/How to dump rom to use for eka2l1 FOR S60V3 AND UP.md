## 📱 For S60v3 and Newer Devices

Dumping ROMs from S60v3 and above is pretty straightforward — just follow these steps:

### Steps:

1. **Hack your phone** using any method.
   - For **Nokia devices**, TMH is a good option.
   - For **non-Nokia devices**, try the **Quick Hack Kit Beta**.

2. **Install the required apps**:
   - `RomPatcherPlus` ✅ *(required)*
   - `Dumber` ✅ *(required)*
   - `X-plore` *(optional but handy)*

3. Open **RomPatcherPlus**, enable these two patches:
   - `InstallServer`
   - `Open4All`  
   Then go to **Options > Advanced > Dump ROM**.

4. **Open Dumber** and let it do its thing.  
   Once done, you’ll have two files:
   - One `.dmp` file
   - One `.rpkg` file  

   ✅ **Rename the `.dmp` file to `.rom`**, and if you want, rename both files to match your device’s name (just to keep things tidy).

🎉 And you’re done! You now have a working ROM for EKA2L1.

You can even share it online via Mega, Google Drive, etc., if you'd like to help others out.
