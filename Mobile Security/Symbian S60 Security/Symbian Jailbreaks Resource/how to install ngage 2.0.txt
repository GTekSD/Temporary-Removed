1)Hack your phone
2)after you hacked your phone, install ngage app (1.40 version is recommended)
3)put game files with .n-gage extesion in N-Gage folder on the memory card (E: drive on most phones)
4)turn on patches in rompatcher, and open the ngage app
5)wait for it to initialize games, and then istall them
6)after you installed games, turn off patches in rompatcher

and that's it, you should now have working ngage 2.0 games!

If it didn't work, try reinstalling the app, or try different version. If that didn't work, join the eka2l1 discord server and we should be able to help you out
