step 1:Hack your phone using any method (for nokia devices i recommend tmh, for non-nokia: quick hack kit beta)

step 2:Install rompatcherplus + dumber (required) and x-plore (optional)

step 3:In rompatcher, enable installserver and open4all, after that go to options, advanced, dump rom

step 4:Now install and open dumber, let it dump, and after that you should have 2 files, one dmp, one rpkg, change the .dmp file extension to .rom and optionally, 
change the file names to the device that you dumped.

And that's it, after that you should have a working rom for EKA2L1, if you want to, you can upload it to mega, google drive or any other file sharing service.

if you have any problems join the EKA2L1 discord and you should be able to resolve them https://discord.gg/SbaG2hca89. you can also check here for all dumped roms https://mega.nz/folder/Z5cx3IgS#hOtuN-6OOtWW5_Pvj_fUuQ
