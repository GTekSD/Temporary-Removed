## 🔓 Symbian^3 Hacking Kits

Gain full file system access and install unsigned apps (Open4All + InstallServer).

> Note: Some Java ME apps contain undetectable malware (e.g., SMS senders).

### ROMPatcher+ Lite

- Officially signed
- Doesn’t include required LDD drivers
- Hacking kits restore drivers from antivirus quarantine

### Methods

| Tool / Antivirus      | Best for        | Notes                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Norton Hack**        | Belle FP1-     | Set date to 2011–12, remove SIM, ignore incompatibility warning       |
| **SafeManager**        | Belle FP2      | Use FileMgr to copy `updatedswicertstore.dat` to system folders       |
| **Trend Micro Hack**   | Belle FP1      | Extract quarantine to `C:\tmquarantine\`, remove after use            |
| **Doctor Web Hack**    | Anna or lower  | Unpack to memory card, install Dr.Web on same memory                  |

⚠️ UMU-based hacks (Defenx, UMU Mobile Security) no longer work – services down.

📌 For Sony Ericsson (S60v5):

- Needs inactive SIM
- After detecting current date → no downgrade/hack possible
- ROMPatcher+ must be whitelisted in `excludelist.txt`

📺 You can also self-sign apps. [YouTube Video: How to Self Sign](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQA-8FSLMJc)
